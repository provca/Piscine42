# Why the 42 school rules can be less efficient

The 42 school rules, while promoting discipline and structure, can hinder real-world programming skills. Strict adherence to rules like limiting function lines and avoiding certain programming structures often leads to over-engineering and unnecessary focus on aesthetics rather than functionality. In the industry, the ability to adapt quickly and solve problems efficiently is more important than following rigid formatting guidelines. The rules can also stifle creativity and flexibility, which are crucial for modern software development. While they help establish clean code, they may not efficiently prepare students for the practical, fast-paced demands of the tech world.
